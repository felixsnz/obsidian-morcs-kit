# wgpu MORC

## What is wgpu ?

wgpu is a [[Rust Crate|Crate]] graphics library/[[Rust Crate|Crate]] for rust [[Rust]] based on the [[WebGPU]] technical specification.
Applications or games created with wgpu, run natively on modern graphics [[API]] such as [[Vulkan]], DirectX 12/11, Metal and for browsers through [[WebAssembly]] following the [[WebGPU]] or [[WebGL]] standard.

wgpu is special because it takes advantage of all the benefits offered by [[Rust]], but all focused on [[Computer Graphics|graphics]]. I personally consider that it aims to become the standard for the future development of graphics applications.
## Highlights of wgpu

- **Multiplatform**: Its design allows it to work on various platforms, from desktop systems to web browsers, offering great flexibility for software development.
- **Use of Modern Graphics APIs**: wgpu integrates with the most advanced graphics technologies, maximizing performance and taking advantage of the latest innovations in computational graphics.
- **Future of Graphics Development**: With its modern approach and broad compatibility, wgpu is emerging as a potential standard for future computer graphics development.
