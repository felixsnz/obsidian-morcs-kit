# Buffers

In [[wgpu]] is a contiguous segment of memory on the GPU designed to store graphics data, such as structures or arrays. These buffers are key to the performance and organization of graphics data, allowing elements such as vertices and colors to be manipulated efficiently without the need to re-compile [[shaders]] for each change, which is critical for speed and flexibility in rendering.

Types of buffers in wgpu:

1. [[Vertex Buffer]]
2. [[Index Buffer]]
