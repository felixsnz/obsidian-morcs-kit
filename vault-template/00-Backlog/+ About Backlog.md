# Backlog

The **00-Backlog** folder is where all new notes are added by default. It is designed to capture spontaneous and quick ideas without worrying about classifying them instantly or polishing them too much.

When reviewing the backlog, either at the end of the day or days later, you decide whether an idea is valuable or discarded, if it is valuable you finish polishing it until you are satisfied with its content and decide whether it is a MOC, MORC or Card.
