# What is Obsidian? 
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) mirrors the non-linear nature of human thought, facilitating a seamless flow of ideas and connections. It's a space where your notes evolve organically, allowing you to weave a rich tapestry of knowledge that reflects your own understanding and insights.

# Project Description
Welcome to the "MORCs Obsidian Template", a structured starting point for organizing your thoughts, knowledge, and ideas within Obsidian.

## Inspiration
This template is inspired from [Chris Pomeroy](https://www.youtube.com/@Peepnbrick/featured)'s video ["How to achieve more while studying less - Obsidian & Conceptual Notes"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYJsGksojms&t=864s&ab_channel=ChrisPomeroy) and [Nick Milo](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/download-lyt-kit)'s [LYT (Linking Your Thinking)](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/download-lyt-kit) template.
It aims to blend the best of both approaches: the structured organization of Nickâ€™s vault and the focus on concepts (in this case, Cards) from Chris.

## Integration Approach
I found the breadth of Nick's template a bit too extensive for my use, as I believe Obsidian excels primarily as a note-taking and learning tool. For other purposes, like planning or management, I prefer to use Notion. Similarly, while Chris's freeform approach to note-taking initially seemed appealing, I realized the need for some structure to prevent information from becoming unmanageable over time.

This template adopts two key components from Nick's approach: the MOCs and Cards. MOCs (Maps of Content) are used as a broad content atlas, while Cards are more granular pieces of information like concept notes, atomic notes, reviews, etc.

## Introducing MORCs
I realized there was a need for an intermediate concept, which I call "MORC" (**Middle-of-the-road concept**). MORCs are essentially more specific than MOCs but broader than a single concept (Card). For example, under my broad interests like Computer Graphics and Game Development, a MORC related to Computer Graphics could be a technology like [WebGPU](https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu/), which is significant within the scope of computer graphics but not as broad as a larger topic (MOC)

## Why MORCs?
You could perfectly organize your second brain without **MORCs**, but they offer a broader and more specific vision of your topics of interest, those that will be part of your stack of technologies for example, that you will end up putting into practice, and who knows what relationships you may find between them.

# Vault Structure
This template organizes information into several key folders, each designed for a specific type of content:

- **[Backlog](vault-template/00-Backlog/+%20About%20Backlog.md):** Default folder for newly created notes, awaiting further categorization.
- **[MOCs](vault-template/01-MOCs/+%20About%20MOCs.md) (Maps of Content):** Broad themes that serve as major reference points in your knowledge network.
- **[MORCs](vault-template/02-MORCs/+%20About%20MORCs.md) (Middle of the Road Concepts):** Not as expansive as MOCs, but more detailed than simple notes.
- **[Cards](vault-template/03-Cards/+%20About%20Cards.md):** Contains atomic notes - distinct, clear concepts, ideas, reviews, recipes, etc.
- **[Diary](vault-template/04-Diary/+%20About%20Diary.md):** For daily reflections or journal entries.
- **[Templates](vault-template/05-Templates/+%20About%20Templates.md):** Ready-to-use templates for various types of notes.
- **[Assets](vault-template/06-Assets/+%20About%20Assets.md):** A place to store resources like images or audio files that support your notes.
- **[Home](vault-template/Home.md):** An introductory note, serving as the central hub for navigation and overview of the vault.

# Templates
the following are the current note templates, basically non-blank .md notes, to serve as a blueprint for new notes.
* [Card](vault-template/05-Templates/Card.md)
* [Card with inner note](vault-template/05-Templates/Card%20with%20inner%20note.md)  
* [MOCs and MORCs](vault-template/05-Templates/MOCs%20and%20MORCs.md)  


# Usage

- Customize each folder according to your personal or professional needs.
- Use the Home note to set your objectives and outline the structure of your vault.
- Feel free to add, remove, or modify any part of this template to better suit your individual workflow.

This template is a guideline to help you start building your own personalized digital knowledge base in Obsidian. Explore and adapt it to create a system that works best for you.

# Examples
To help you get started, some folders contain example notes. These serve as practical note examples of how each folder can be utilized. Feel free to explore these examples to better understand the potential uses of each section.
