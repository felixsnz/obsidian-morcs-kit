# WebGPU MORC

## What is WebGPU ?

WebGPU is an emerging web technology specification, created by the World Wide Web Consortium ([[W3C]]), intended to enable more efficient and powerful access to the [[GPU]] for web applications. This standard seeks to overcome the limitations of [[WebGL]] by providing more direct, low-level control over the graphics and computational capabilities of modern [[GPU|GPUs]].

**Key Aspects**:

- **Compatibility and Performance**: Designed to be cross-platform, optimizing graphics performance across different devices and browsers.
- Detailed Control**: Gives developers more granular control over the GPU, enabling more complex and efficient graphics and processing.
- **Security and Modernity**: Incorporates updated security standards and leverages the most advanced features of today's GPUs.

## Objective
Facilitate the creation of advanced web applications with intensive graphics and high performance calculations, opening new possibilities in web design, online games, virtual reality, among others.

## Implementations
There are currently two implementations of this standard, [[wgpu]] and [[dawn]].
