# MORCs

The folder MORCs (Middle-of-the-Road Concepts) Unlike the folder [[+ About MOCs|01-MOCs]], is intended to store terms that do not end up being a **MOC** but are not something so basic as to put them in the folder [[+ About Cards|03-Cards]].

A **MORC** is almost a **MOC**, but with the difference that it does not end up being a big topic, for example, for me a **MOC** is [[Computer Science]], but within this there are big topics that I consider too large to put them in the [[+ About Cards|03-Cards]] folder, for example, different programming languages such as [[Python]] or [[Rust]] could be **MORCs**.


*Note: The decision to categorize a topic as **MOC** or **MORC** is personal.
