# MORCs
The folder MORCs (Middle-of-the-Road Concepts) Unlike the folder [[+ About MOCs|01-MOCs]], is intended to store terms that do not end up being a **MOC** but are not something so basic as to put them in the folder [[+ About Cards|03-Cards]].

## What is a MORC?
A **MORC** is almost a **MOC**, but with the difference that it does not end up being a big topic, for example, for me a **MOC** is [[Computer Science]], but within this there are big topics that I consider too large to put them in the [[+ About Cards|03-Cards]] folder, for example, different programming languages such as [[Python]] or [[Rust]] could be **MORCs**.

## Why not just use [[+ About MOCs|MOCs]]?
you could perfectly organize your second brain without **MORCs**, but they offer a broader and more specific vision of your topics of interest, those that will be part of your stack of technologies for example, that you will end up putting into practice, and who knows what relationships you may find between them.

*Note: The decision to categorize a topic as **MOC** or **MORC** is personal.
